## 1. 🏠 Your Dashboard — Home Base

**URL:** `https://mortgage-flyer-pro.vercel.app/dashboard/adrian-mitchell`

When you open your dashboard, you'll see:

- **Your name, photo, and Works Real Estate branding** at the top
- **Performance stats** — asset views, active leads, conversion rate
- **Product Suite** — quick-launch buttons for each tool
- **Active Assets** — all your live flyers and tours

### What to do first:
1. Open your dashboard link above
2. Familiarize yourself with the 4 product tiles:
   - **Listing Studio** → Create property flyers
   - **Buyer's Experience** → Premium tour detailing for your buyers (⭐ your bread & butter)
   - **Rate Watch** → Live mortgage rate tracker
   - **Leads Dashboard** → See who's clicking your flyers

## 2. 📊 Sharing Live Rate Flyers with Buyers

This is the #1 tool for a buyer's agent. Your buyers are always asking: *"What are rates right now?"* — now you have a live, co-branded answer.

### How it works:
1. I (Scott) create a co-branded rate flyer with your contact info and headshot
2. You receive a **permanent link** that always shows current rates
3. You share that link with your buyer clients
4. Clients see live rates + your face + your contact info
5. Clients can scan a QR code to start a pre-approval

### Your typical sharing workflow:

```
Step 1: Copy your live flyer link
Step 2: Paste into a text, email, or social post  
Step 3: That's it — rates are always current
```

### Where to share it:
- 📱 **Text message** — After a showing, text the link along with your feedback
- 📧 **Email** — Include in your drip campaigns and newsletters
- 📲 **Instagram Bio** — Add the link to your Linktree or bio
- 🏡 **Open houses** — Display the QR code on your sign-in sheet
- ✍️ **Email signature** — Add a "View Current Rates" link
- 📋 **Buyer consultations** — Pull it up on your phone during meetings

---

## 3. ✨ The Buyer Experience Studio — Your Secret Weapon

**URL:** `https://mortgage-flyer-pro.vercel.app/buyer-agent`

This is where you differentiate yourself from every other buyer's agent. After you tour a property with your client, use this tool to create a **personalized property experience page** that you send to your buyer.

### What it does:
- Pulls in listing data (address, photos, specs, MLS#)
- Lets you write **"The Agent's Take"** — your personal perspective on why this home fits *this specific buyer*
- Add **Tour Insights** — specific observations (kitchen lighting, street noise level, etc.)
- Add **Local Gems** — your favorite nearby restaurants, parks, coffee shops
- Personalize it with **buyer's name** and **financing strategy**
- AI-powered **Ghost Detailer** can help you write compelling descriptions

### Step-by-step:

1. **Open the Buyer Experience Studio** from your dashboard
2. **Select/confirm the listing** you toured
3. **Write your Agent's Take** — Be personal. Mention things you discussed with the buyer:
   > *"Sarah & Mike, this home checks all the boxes we talked about — the quiet cul-de-sac for the kids, the updated kitchen you wanted, and the 3-car garage for Mike's workshop."*
4. **Add Tour Insights** — Click "Add Insight" for each observation:
   - Category: Kitchen, Primary, Outdoors, Arrival, General
   - Type: Highlight, Vibe, Pro, Con
5. **Add Local Gems** — Your insider knowledge:
   - That coffee shop you love
   - The park that's a 5-minute walk
   - The school that has great ratings
6. **Set the Financing Strategy** — Match what you've discussed:
   - Wealth Builder (30yr Fixed)
   - Cash Flow Maximizer (ARM)
   - Low Down Payment (FHA/VA)
7. **Click "Preview Live"** to see what the buyer will see
8. **Click "Share Experience"** to copy the link

### 💡 Pro Tip:
Send this within **2 hours** of the showing while the experience is fresh. It shows the buyer you're invested in their search and gives them a professional recap to share with their spouse, co-buyer, or family.

## 4. 🏗️ Property Listing Flyers

**URL:** `https://mortgage-flyer-pro.vercel.app/builder`

Even as a buyer's agent, listing flyers are useful for:
- **Coming Soon** properties you're previewing
- **Sharing listings** you found for your buyers
- **Open house** materials
- **Social media** posts about properties you're excited about

### How to create one:
1. Click **"Listing Studio"** from your dashboard
2. Enter property details (address, price, beds/baths, etc.)
3. Upload property photos
4. Choose a layout template (Luxury, Modern, Traditional, Property Listing)
5. Your info is already pre-loaded (Works Real Estate branding)
6. Export as PDF, social media graphic, or share a live link

---

## 5. 📈 Tracking Buyer Leads

**URL:** `https://mortgage-flyer-pro.vercel.app/leads`

Every time a buyer interacts with your flyers, we capture that activity. The Leads Dashboard shows you:

- **Who's viewing** your flyers
- **Lead contact info** from form submissions
- **Engagement metrics** — which properties are getting the most attention
- **Real-time alerts** when new leads come in

### What to do with leads:
1. Check your Leads Dashboard **daily** (or set up notifications)
2. Respond to new leads **within 5 minutes** for best conversion
3. Use the rate flyer link as your follow-up — it keeps the conversation warm

## 7. 🎯 Best Practices for Buyer Agents

### ✅ DO:
- **Share the rate link at every buyer touchpoint** — first meeting, after showings, in follow-ups
- **Send a Buyer Experience recap within 2 hours** of every showing
- **Add the rate link to your email signature**
- **Use the QR code** on printed materials and at open houses
- **Mention rates are live** — buyers love that it's not a stale screenshot
- **Personalize the Agent's Take** — generic = forgettable, specific = memorable
- **Track your leads daily** and respond fast

### ❌ DON'T:
- Screenshot rates and send as an image (they'll be outdated)
- Promise specific rates to buyers — always say "as of today"
- Send generic Buyer Experience pages — the whole point is personalization
- Ignore the Leads Dashboard — those are warm leads ready to act

### 🔥 Power Moves:
1. **The "Rate Drop" Text** — When rates go down, text all your active buyers:
   > *"Hey [Name], rates just dropped! Check it out: [LINK]. Want to revisit any of the homes we looked at?"*

2. **The "Showing Recap"** — After every showing, send the Buyer Experience page. No other agent in Portland is doing this.

3. **The "Pre-Approval Push"** — When a buyer is on the fence:
   > *"Let's at least get you pre-approved so when we find the right one, we can move fast. Here are today's rates: [LINK]"*

4. **The "Market Update"** — Weekly Instagram story or post with your rate link. Position yourself as the rate-savvy agent.
