Hi Celeste,

Here are your flyers for **905 NE 43rd St Unit #111** — ready to go right now. I made two versions so you can match the financing to each buyer:

| | Down Payment | Est. Monthly | Flyer Link |
|---|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Version 1** | 5% down ($8,995) | ~$2,370/mo | **[Open 5% Down Flyer →](https://mortgage-flyer-pro.vercel.app/property-live/seattle-condo-celeste-5down)** |
| **Version 2** | 10% down ($17,990) | ~$2,267/mo | **[Open 10% Down Flyer →](https://mortgage-flyer-pro.vercel.app/property-live/seattle-condo-celeste-10down)** |

These are live web links — they work great on phone or desktop. You can text them directly to buyers, drop them in an email, or share on social. Both have your Century 21 branding and my financing info built in.

### Something I want to show you

I've been building a marketing platform specifically for our agent partners, and your flyers are running on it. Rather than going back and forth on one-off flyers for each listing, I wanted to give you and your team direct access so you can:

- **See all your active flyers in one place** — your own dashboard
- **Share flyers instantly** — text, email, or social with one click
- **Get buyer leads** — when someone scans the QR code or clicks "I'm Interested," you get notified
- **Track engagement** — see which flyers are getting views

**Your dashboard is already set up:**  
👉 **[mortgage-flyer-pro.vercel.app/dashboard/celeste-zarling](https://mortgage-flyer-pro.vercel.app/dashboard/celeste-zarling)**

For every new listing we work together, I'll spin up your co-branded flyers and they'll automatically show up in your dashboard — no back and forth, no waiting on PDFs. You'll always have a live link ready to share.
